Double D coils (one as exciter, the other as pickup)
Measured with three setups of sensitivity area (area of overlap), open is for largest area and close for almost zero area.
Sweep 5-10 kHz, 100 ms, 5Vpp
Unfortunately, there was an iron beam on the underside of the table before, so these measurements are done with the coil placed on cardboard box 20 cm above the table and above the area without the beam.
